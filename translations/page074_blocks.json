The flies are harmless, and will settle back onto the corpse after a few minutes. The body once had four arms, but they have all been sawn off; the bones and a surgical saw can be found in a bucket under the bench. Having developed a taste for human flesh, Rousseaux has arranged for the cannibals to bring him bodies.",
