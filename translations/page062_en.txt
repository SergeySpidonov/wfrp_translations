[H1] NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS

[H2] The Villagers

The villagers of the Baumenvolk are a hardy lot. The nearby forest, and the Barren Hills beyond, have encouraged them to be well prepared for interlopers. You may use the profile given on page 52, Grissenwald Farmers and Farm Labourers, for their statistics, but each adult in the village has a 50% chance of carrying a shortbow. If so, they also have a Ranged (Bow) Skill of 35.

[B] Corrobreth the Priest

Corrobreth’s face bears deep score-marks down each side of his cheeks, which are very evident when he smiles. He does not indulge in casual conversation, but when he does speak it is to offer advice or provide important information. Like all followers of Rhya, he avoids taking life unless it is necessary for sustenance or defence. Consequently, he prefers to avoid conflict, relying on stealth or compromise to avoid danger.

Corrobreth is aware of the changes caused by the warpstone meteorite. He knows the location of the meteor crater, and of the monoliths erected around it. He has never had any cause to go to the site himself, but he is willing to act as the adventurers’ guide.
