[H1] THE PHARMACIST

Elvyra Kleinestun is well known in Weissbruck, and nearly everyone local can tell the adventurers where to find her. Elvyra’s home (see the map below) is a simple, two-up-two- down cottage near The Happy Man inn. The cottage is well kept and recently painted, with window boxes of herbs and flowers. As the adventurers approach, however, they will notice that one of the windows has been smashed and its window box is broken. An adventurer making an

[B] Average (+20) Perception

Test will see that it was smashed from the outside, and that a couple of threads caught on a broken glass show that someone has climbed through it. Looking through the window, the signs of a violent struggle are obvious, with broken furniture, glass, and so on.

There are no signs of life in the house, and knocking doesn’t bring anyone to the door. The house seems deserted. The door lock is a normal one, and requires a

Test, SL 2 to open.

If the adventurers search the house, each one can make a

[B] Very Hard (-30) Intelligence

[B] B. Kitchen/Storeroom

The kitchen has been thoroughly ransacked. The contents of the shelves and cupboards have been thrown on to the floor alongside pots, pans, and broken crockery.

The steps to the cellar are concealed behind a large cupboard in the kitchen, and the hidden door will only be noticed if the Characters look behind it. An

[B] Average (+20) Perception

Test will reveal a slight draft from behind the cupboard. If the hidden door is not discovered, you can give the adventurers a

Test to hear a faint noise coming from the cellar. The noise is slightly louder near the cupboard.

[B] C. Cellar

The hidden door opens on to a steep, narrow flight of steps leading 15 ft down into the cellar. As the adventurers open the door, a small, indistinct shape shoots to the bottom of the stairs and is lost in the darkness. Anyone who makes a

[B] Challenging (+0) Initiative

Test is not surprised. The mysterious shape is about 3 ft high and humanoid, but nothing else can be seen in the dim light. Characters with the Night Vision Talent will be able to see something moving behind a jumble of boxes. There is a faint scrabbling noise from the cellar, then silence.

There is a missing step about halfway down the stairs. If the first Character down the stairs has the Night Vision Talent, a light, or makes an
