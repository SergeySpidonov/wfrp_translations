Anyone who examines the book will notice that it is resting on an ancient piece of parchment. The parchment is also written in Classical, and foretells Sigmar’s return to save the Empire in its hour of direst need (see handout below). Any Character who reads this aloud (you may determine if it is with suitable reverence) will receive a blessing.",

Go now, and find the source of the chaos which warps my lands .’ The lanterns dim and flare again, leaving the statue looking normal.
