If the Players dawdle or delay too much, or get side-tracked by other events, you can inject a hint that they are wasting time by having a cultist or two watch them from a distance. This monitoring becomes more overt as Heidlemann moves towards his goal. If the Players are sluggards, then you should feel free to rearrange matters so that Heidlemann has the sixth key as he arrives first, rather than second, at the Signal Tower.
