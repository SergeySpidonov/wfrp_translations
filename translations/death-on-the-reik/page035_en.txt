[H2] The Red Crown Cultists

[B] Etelka Herzen – Human Master Wizard

On the surface, Etelka is a friendly but reserved noblewoman of medium build, with shoulder-length blonde hair, and blue eyes. Underneath, she is ruthless in the pursuit of her aims, and deals harshly with any interference. In order to conceal her identity, she only uses magic when there are unlikely to be witnesses (or survivors). If confronted, she usually waits a Round or two before deciding to cast spells. Etelka’s presence is unmistakable, for her corruption is slowly bubbling out of her. Her skin exudes a very pungent odour, which she masks with strong perfumes. The fragrance sometimes lingers behind her for as much as 15 minutes, and anyone entering an area that she has recently left will not fail to notice it.

[B] Shadow the Cat

Etelka’s black cat, Shadow, accompanies her wherever she goes. Although Shadow appears intelligent, with a disconcertingly knowing look in her eyes, she is an ordinary black cat.

[B] TRAVELLING CASE

Etelka’s case contains her personal possessions and dozens of vials of perfume. These are very small and may easily be mistaken for potions. There is a wide range of fragrances in the vials, although lavender and musk are Etelka’s favourites, and make up the majority.

[B] POTION OF FLIGHT

When drunk, this potion affects the drinker as a Flight Spell (

[B] WFRP

, page 244). The effect lasts for 20 Rounds, minus the drinker’s Toughness bonus.

[B] WAND OF ONYX

This wand of polished, black mineral acts as a well of power. Once per day the bearer of the wand, when casting a spell of up to CN 5, can consider that spell to have been Critically Cast with Total Power (WFRP page 234). On doing so, roll 1d100. If the result is less than or equal to the CN of the spell, the wand shatters and is destroyed, dealing 1d10 Wounds to each Character within 2 yards.
