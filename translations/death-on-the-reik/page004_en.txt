Welcome to

[B] Death on the Reik

, the second volume in the Director’s Cut edition of the

[B] Enemy Within

campaign. While it can be played on its own, it has been designed for use after completing

[B] Enemy in Shadows

.

This book falls into eight chapters, with a preliminary section that summarises the various plots that the adventurers will encounter. Some of these plots come to a conclusion within the pages of this book, while others lay the foundations for adventures to come. The companion book for this adventure includes supplemental material and additional adventures which you can use to make this part of the

[B] Enemy Within

even more entertaining.

In this adventure, the Characters learn more about the cult of the Purple Hand, the threat it poses to the Empire, and why it is so interested in them. They also encounter a rival cult, the Red Crown, which has different methods and objectives.

Warpstone plays a major role in this adventure. This is a stony substance made from the pure essence of Chaos. Derived from concentrations of dark magic, it is rumoured to originate from Morrslieb, the ill-omened second moon of the Old World. It is much sought after by followers of Chaos and, most of all, by the Skaven ratmen.

Burrowing beneath many parts of the world, Skaven are seldom seen. Many think they do not exist, and some of the Empire’s rulers deliberately foster this notion to avoid widespread panic.

The Characters find that many people refuse to believe their tales of an encounter with the Skaven, and some may actively try to silence them.

The Characters pick up several clues as they travel along the Empire’s great rivers. These point to Middenheim, the famous city of the White Wolf. There, they learn of a religious schism that could tear the Empire apart, of a runaway noble whose family has some very dubious connections, and of Purple Hand agents active within the fortress city. All of these plot lines lead them into the next volume,

[B] Power Behind the Throne

.

Along the way, the adventurers will travel the great rivers that are the arteries of trade and transportation throughout the Empire. They learn about commerce, and may become wealthy as traders. They’ll meet the people of the Empire in all their variety: urban and rural, common and noble, law-abiding and criminal, and all types in between. The fledgling adventurers who set out for Altdorf to seek their fortunes in

become seasoned and well-travelled veterans as they make their way through
