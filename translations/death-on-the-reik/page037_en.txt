[B] The Engineers (6) – Dwarf Engineer

There are six Engineers remaining when the adventurers first meet Aynjulls: Thingrim, Belegol, Kardak, Gudrun, Guzul and Minak. All are frightened and confused by the mysterious deaths of their colleagues, although they try not to let it show.

[H2] The Undead at the Observatory

[B] Ghoul Champion

One of the Wizard Dagmar's final experiments, this unfortunate creature has guarded its long dead creator’s home for centuries. Preserved by foul sorcery and the occasional foolhardy rat, the Ghoul is ravenous for a more substantial meal.

[B] *PARALYSING VENOM

The Ghoul has been enchanted not only to bind it to the tower, but also to give its bite a unique effect. Rather than causing a Poisoned Condition, those afflicted by the Ghoul’s venom gain the Unconscious condition instead. This lasts for 1d10 hours minus the victim’s Toughness Bonus, to a minimum of 1 hour. Unlike the normal Unconscious condition, the ghoul’s bite renders its victims immobile, but otherwise aware of their surroundings and exactly what is being done to them.
