If the Characters move towards the buzzing mass, hundreds of flies swarm into air, revealing a decaying human body. The flies are harmless, and will settle back onto the corpse after a few minutes. The body once had four arms, but they have all been sawn off; the bones and a surgical saw can be found in a bucket under the bench. Having developed a taste for human flesh, Rousseaux has arranged for the cannibals to bring him bodies.

On the table are a set of scales, a pipette, and assorted vials of coloured water and sand. One of these vials contains warpstone dust. There is also a gallon jar of rotgut, a length of rubber tubing, a funnel, and a stock of empty blue bottles.

These rooms are where Rousseaux (F), Frau Blucher (G) and Kurt (H) sleep. There is a miniature portrait of Lady Margritte over Rousseaux’s bed. On his dressing table is a jar containing a white salve, and another containing the white powder that he uses to treat his flaking skin.
