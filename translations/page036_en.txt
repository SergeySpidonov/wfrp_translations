[B] Ernst Heidlemann

Ernst is a thin, lanky, weasel-faced individual with light-brown hair and a pasty complexion. He masquerades as a recently qualified physician in the employ of Lady Etelka, and maintains this deception by refusing to treat anyone but her. Ernst is quiet and reserved, seldom speaking, but is often rude to those who are of no use to him. He is cruel and calculating, and while on the mission he will hire thugs to deal with any opposition, saving his powers until he can use them to the best effect.

[H2] The Dwarven Engineers

Of the twelve Dwarven engineers who started work on the site under the leadership of Aynjulls Isembeard, only six now remain — and at least two of them seem determined to desert their posts.

[B] Aynjulls Isembeard

Aynjulls usually wears an oil-stained leather jacket, bright- red breeches, and great hobnailed boots. Fiercely proud of her reputation for swift and reliable work, she can be a somewhat gruff and surly character. The continuing disappearance of her workforce has shaken her to the point where she is ready to try anything — even if it means asking for help from an Elf!

[B] Wasting Sickness

: Ernst suffers from a wasting disease, an affliction that is slowly eating away at his being. He has been supplied by his masters with a preparation to offset this affliction, and he carries the vials with him at all times. Without it, he loses 1 Toughness point every 12 hours, dying when his Toughness reaches zero.
