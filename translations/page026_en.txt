=== СТРАНИЦА 26 ===

allows the four skeletons to enter the fight under her command. A normal ghost could not do such a thing with normal skeletons. The manner of their deaths, and the presence of warpstone, have given the undead strange and unexpected powers. They also have a thirst for vengeance and hate the followers of Chaos…

[B] Between the Devil’s Bowl and Kemperbad, Day 24–29

An encounter in this section could work well, but will be less dramatic than a confrontation at the Devil’s Bowl or the Signal Tower. If the party needs reinforcements, the conflict could take place near the village of Unterbaum (page 57) or the Inn of the Roaring Falls (page 57). Some of the more able NPCs in either location could help out. A mutant or two, recruited in the warpstone-irradiated hills, can be added to the Red Crown expedition if the adventurers’ party is strong.

[B] Between Kemperbad and the Signal Tower, Day 29–36

Again, an encounter during this period can work well, but it lacks the drama of a confrontation at the Signal Tower. For a really dramatic conclusion to the chase, it might be preferable to have the two groups miss each other in Kemperbad. The adventurers then reach the Signal Tower first and the cultists arrive at a suitable later time. Alternatively, some of the tricks mentioned above could be used to delay the adventurers so that

they find the cultists in control of the Signal Tower, with the surviving Dwarfs held prisoner.

[H2] The Timeline

The next part of the adventure revolves around the actions of two groups of people in different locations. Although the Players don’t know it yet, they are racing against Red Crown cultists. It may not seem much like a race, as travel is only ever as fast as the nearest horse or riverboat, but keeping track of events in the timeline will make your life as a GM a bit easier. There are long distances to cover, secrets to reveal, and not a lot of time for the Players to do either.

The ‘Day’ column is effectively a clock, measuring the progress of the cultists in obtaining the last key needed to get into Dagmar’s secret library beneath the Signal Tower. A game aid has been included at the back of the book to keep track of your party’s location. If the Players dawdle or delay too much, or get side-tracked by other events, you can inject a hint that they are wasting time by having a cultist or two watch them from a distance. This monitoring becomes more overt as Heidlemann moves towards his goal. If the Players are sluggards, then you should feel free to rearrange matters so that Heidlemann has the sixth key as he arrives first, rather than second, at the Signal Tower. The adventurers are then in a chase to prevent him reaching the secret library.
