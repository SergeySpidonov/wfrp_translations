[H2] The Boat Survivor, Renate Hausier

A very independent and self-reliant young woman, Renate is often mistaken for a Strigani. She favours brightly coloured, heavily patterned clothing, and usually wears a red headscarf over her raven-black hair, with two large gold hoops hanging from her ears. Renate is naturally cautious (the Players may have another word for her), and has a healthy aversion to danger. She will always try to find some non-violent way out of danger, such as bluffing, hiding, or running away. She loves travelling and seeing different places, and it was this, rather than any particular love for adventure, that motivated her to take up the wandering life of a Pedlar. If the adventurers invite her to join them, she will readily do so, because she realises that she is safer with them than she would be on her own.
