[H2] The Missing Pharmacist

In her late 30s with light brown hair and dark-blue eyes, Elvyra has an engaging, outgoing personality. Beneath her glib exterior lies a penetrating mind with a great enthusiasm for drugs, herbs, and other medical preparations.

She can talk shop all day and most of the night, and is always delighted to make the acquaintance of anyone with similar interests. However, she tends to regard physicians as stuck-up bookworms with little practical knowledge and followers of Verena as simpering idiots with more faith than intelligence, so any such Characters must show that they are truly interested, and preferably knowledgeable, before she warms to them.

Elvyra has lived in Weissbruck for the past two years. Originally from Altdorf, she moved not long after she decided that there was more money in fleecing people than in manufacturing and selling genuine medicines — although she still provides the real thing to her neighbours and anyone else she likes. The characters will probably have met her in Bögenhafen.

[H2] The Pharmacist’s Girl, Liza Sauber

Liza wears a simple smock and goes about barefoot. She is very fond of Elvyra, and will do whatever she can to help her.
